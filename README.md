# Flo2009PortfolioPage

## Description

- I could use the learned skills in HTML and CSS in a real-life project
- A portfolio page is a good experience to learn what it takes later on to represent one-self
- I learned how to build my first webpage from scratch. Learned how to use the HTML elemets and after that combine that with styling.

## Usage

The page has a navigation on top that brings you to the different sections. The main project image is a bit bigger. The image is also a link to the deployed web-page
