            <p> I am always curious to learn new ways to execute things. I have decided that I take one of my passions, creating Software, 
                to another level by joining the Columbia Software Development Bootcamp!
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering and a Masters in Businees Administration (MBA)
            </p>
            <p>
                I love being around my family. As an Ultra-Marathon Runner and Triathlete I am also very passionate to be outside. 
                I am always learning, exploring and surging to make processes more efficient and easier to follow.
                I love to work with different kind of people/cultures and learn from them and their experience.
                Feel free to reach out to me.

                    <h4>Initial Bootcamp Project</h4>
                    <p>
                        In the first Project we were exposed to I was able 
                        to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and Java Script. I needed to create
                        a GitHub account and started working with a Repo. Thus exposing me to the 
                        Command line as well.

                    <h4>Troublshooting Project</h4>
                    <p>
                        The second Project I was given, it was necessary to troubleshoot the code 
                        to make the page fully functioning. I needed to learn how to work with the HTML Elements,
                        such as "header", "footer", "section" and how to apply syles correctly in CSS to them.
